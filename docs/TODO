This is TODO list of required enhancements and features. 
The '*'s mean a complexity of implementation.


***** Implement multi-interface capturing and filtration
***** Add defragmentation IP packets(v4/v6)
**** Improve performance of rpcgen-generated code. Exclude copying data to dynamically allocated arrays by standard rpcgen routines
****** Implement filtration of NFSv4 payload data in READ/WRITE operations
*** Introduce RuntimeStatistic class and make it accessible via API for plugins
*** Implement libwatch.so plugin (it should mimic to nfswatch tool). Use functionality of RuntimeStatistic
****  Add batching to Analyzers API. Passing a sequence of RPC Procedures to an analyser
*** Implement drawing graphics in analyzers via gnuplot directly, without external .sh script
**** Implement libpyadapter.so or libjavaadapter.so
